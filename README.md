# STUDENT REVIEW APP
# TMTNT
Team Project

First thing we see is a nice landing page with login field

After login student should be able to see :
-what assignments are due and when
-status of an assignement that is under review and if it needs correcting
-a way to submit or resubmit an assignment for review

when submitting student musst provide :
- URL to the github repo
- which branch is correct one
- ??maybe in the future option to upload files for review

once submitted the status changes from "pending submission" -> "submitted"
